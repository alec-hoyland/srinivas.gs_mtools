# mtools by srinivas.gs

This repository contains a set of toolboxes that makes working
with MATLAB much easier. All code here is organized into different 
toolboxes, which means that:

* functions that are related to one another are grouped together
* your namespace isn't polluted by the functions in this toolbox
* you only have to add this folder to your path (and not subfolders) to access all these tools

What can you do with this? Read on:
